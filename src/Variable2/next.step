Congratulations on implementing a parser for your simple programming language!

To take your parser to the next level and turn it into a compiler, you'll need to add the following components:

1. **Semantic Analysis**: This phase checks the parsed AST for semantic errors, such as type mismatches, undefined variables, and scoping issues. You'll need to implement a symbol table to keep track of declared variables and their types.
2. **Intermediate Code Generation**: In this phase, you'll generate intermediate code (e.g., three-address code) from the parsed AST. This code will be platform-independent and can be optimized later.
3. **Optimizer** (optional): If you want to optimize the generated code, you can add an optimizer phase. This can include techniques like constant folding, dead code elimination, and register allocation.
4. **Code Generation**: In this final phase, you'll generate machine-specific code from the intermediate code. This code will be specific to the target platform (e.g., x86, ARM, etc.).
5. **Assembler and Linker** (optional): If you want to create an executable file, you'll need to add an assembler and linker phase. The assembler will translate the machine code into object files, and the linker will combine these object files into a single executable file.

Here's a high-level overview of the compiler pipeline:

```

To implement these phases, you can use various techniques and tools, such as:

* For semantic analysis, you can use a symbol table and implement scoping rules, type checking, and other semantic checks.
* For intermediate code generation, you can use a three-address code (TAC) generator, which will produce a platform-independent intermediate representation of the code.
* For optimization, you can use various optimization techniques, such as constant folding, dead code elimination, and register allocation.
* For code generation, you can use a code generator that takes the intermediate code and produces machine-specific code for the target platform.
* For assembly and linking, you can use tools like NASM (Netwide Assembler) and ld (GNU linker) to assemble and link the object files into an executable file.

Some popular tools and libraries that can help you implement these phases include:

* ANTLR (parser generator)
* JavaCC (parser generator)
* LLVM (compiler infrastructure)
* GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
* NASM (Netwide Assembler)
* ld (GNU linker)

Remember, building a compiler is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of computer science concepts, programming languages, and software engineering. If you're new to compiler construction, it's essential to start with a simple language and gradually add features as you gain more experience.
