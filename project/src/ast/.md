ast Folder
The abstract syntax tree (AST) is a hierarchical tree-like data structure that represents the structure of the program.
It's built by the parser and provides a way to represent the program in a way that's easier to work with than the raw source code. 
The example you provided demonstrates a simple Node struct and a function to create new nodes, which could be used as building blocks for constructing an AST.
